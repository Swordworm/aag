Our mission is to provide both adventures and safe recreation in wild forests of Ukrainian Carpathians. Our high qualified guides will do everything to make your holiday with us the most memorable event of your life.

                                        The whole camping holiday from the day you move out is a great activity. Every second of camping will keep you in interest till the day you come back. Our guides will show you how to not get lost in the forest and in case you did, they will teach you some basics of surviving. Every day you will discover new things. In the morning you will drink crystal clean spring water. In the afternoon our guide will show you how to cook such delicious food that you would never cook at home. In the late evening you can practice setting up tents.

                                        We appreciate taking your own equipment, but firstly it has to be checked by our professionals. If you are only planning to buy it you can consult with our guides that know everything about it. For those who don't want to pay a lot of money for equipment for just one camping holiday we have professional equipment that can be rented to you for ridiculous price.
